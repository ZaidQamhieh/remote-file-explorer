<!-- NEXT_SESSION_STATUS: HANDOFF -->
# NEXT_SESSION — cross-session handoff

Carryover for work **left unfinished** in a prior session. The `SessionStart`
hook (`.claude/hooks/next-session-guard.sh`) surfaces this file automatically at
the start of every session in this repo — but **only when the status marker on
line 1 reads `HANDOFF`**. When it reads `CLEAR`, there is nothing to resume and
the hook stays silent.

This is repo-local, incomplete-work carryover only. Durable project state,
architecture, and backlog live in the Obsidian wiki (`entities/rfe-backlog.md`),
not here.

## Contract (mirrored in `CLAUDE.md` §"Cross-session handoff")
- **Task finished this session** → set line 1 to `CLEAR` and reset
  `## Open handoff` to the "None" placeholder. Don't leave a resolved handoff to
  rot (that's what made the old version stale).
- **Task NOT finished** → set line 1 to `HANDOFF` and fill `## Open handoff`
  with: the goal, what's done, what's left, exact files/lines to start from, and
  how to verify. Write it so a cold session resumes with zero re-derivation.

## Open handoff

### GOAL: finish the RFE production-readiness audit remediation.

Full 85-finding audit lives in the wiki:
`concepts/rfe-production-readiness-audit-2026-07.md` — it has per-finding
**file:line + why + fix + example**. Read it before touching any finding below;
it is the source of truth.

### PROGRESS (as of 2026-07-20, tenth pass): 78 / 85 closed (count of the
concrete open register below, which is the one source of truth — per-severity
arithmetic subtotals are dropped as of this pass; they drifted twice before
and re-deriving them by hand each pass is how that happened).

**Open register (7 items — this IS the backlog, nothing else):**
- **PR-38** (High) — fixed in the working tree, **NOT committed**:
  `app/lib/features/preview/text_editor.dart` is `MM` (shad-staged).
- **PR-62** (High) — fixed in the working tree, **NOT committed**:
  `app/lib/main.dart` is `MM` (shad-staged); adds a root `ScaffoldMessenger`.
- **PR-36** (High) — fixed in the working tree, **NOT committed**:
  `host_list_screen.dart` + `host_card.dart`, both `MM`.
- **PR-63** (Medium) — the reusable piece is committed (`40d5e56`,
  `AppTheme.shadColorSchemeFrom`), but the actual fix — wiring it into
  `main.dart`'s `ShadThemeData(colorScheme: ...)` call sites — is **NOT
  committed** (`main.dart` is `MM`). The finding stays open until that lands;
  the helper alone changes no visible behavior.
- **PR-64** (High) — fixed in the working tree, **NOT committed**:
  `photo_backup_screen.dart` + `settings_tile.dart`, both `MM`.
- **PR-73** (Medium) — partial, **NOT committed**: `flutter_markdown` →
  `flutter_markdown_plus` swap (discontinued-package part of the fix) is done
  in `pubspec.yaml`/`pubspec.lock` (both `MM`, shad-staged) +
  `markdown_preview.dart`/`markdown_preview_test.dart` (both clean but left
  uncommitted since committing them alone without the entangled pubspec
  would ship a broken intermediate commit — import of a package not yet
  declared). Verified green in the working tree (`flutter analyze` +
  `flutter test` both clean/all-passing with the swap applied). The
  Gradle/AGP/Kotlin bump and the other 65 stale packages are untouched —
  explicitly flagged by the audit itself as needing controlled waves +
  device regression tests, not a blind autonomous pass.
- **PR-82** (High) — untouched. Needs a fake TLS agent/contract test harness
  + ~20 regression cases per the audit; genuinely large new test
  infrastructure, not a bounded bug-fix. Deliberately not attempted
  unsupervised — a rushed/half-built harness is worse than none.

**Tenth pass (2026-07-20): continuing autonomously across a context
compaction ("fix all the 13 left", then later "continue... don't stop until
all the errors are gone"). 7 commits, 6 findings closed/advanced, all
`flutter analyze`/`go vet`/`go build`/`gofmt` clean and targeted
`flutter test`/`go test` green (full Go suite: 343/343; full Flutter suite:
713/713) before each commit.**
- **PR-59** (SSE half-finished, full close) — user chose "remove" over
  "complete" (`AskUserQuestion`, since the event-producing `hub.Broadcast()`
  call was confirmed dead via exhaustive grep — never invoked anywhere in
  production). Deleted `sse_handler.go`/`_test.go`, `sse_listener.dart`,
  `sse_listener_test.dart`; stripped every call site
  (`server.go`/`main.go`/`explorer_state.dart`/`browse_app_bar.dart`) and
  the `/events` OpenAPI path. Agent commit `710cda3`, client commit `2c969de`.
- **PR-61** (global host metadata/actions ignore caller scope, full close)
  — user authorized all 3 sub-fixes despite possible breaking changes, then
  a corrected follow-up question after I caught my own mischaracterization
  (see below). `/health` now returns only `{status}` to unauthenticated
  callers and full detail (name/version/os/readOnly/addresses/MAC) only to
  an authenticated device — backward-compatible in practice since
  `AgentClient` always attaches the bearer token when one exists.
  `/system/drives` and `/trash` now filter through the request's jailed
  `fsops.Ops` instead of the unjailed base (`Ops.Drives()`,
  `Ops.ListTrash()`, `Ops.EmptyTrash()` — all jail-aware, new tests catch a
  self-caught backwards-jail-direction bug in the first draft). WoL gated to
  block `ReadOnly` (guest-tier) devices only, **not** admin-only — my first
  attempt gated to `ViaLogin`-only, which I caught before committing:
  `/pair` (the phone app's normal flow) never sets `ViaLogin`, so
  admin-gating would have permanently disabled WoL for every real phone,
  not just "old clients" as I'd implied when asking. Reverted, asked a
  corrected question, user picked "block guest/read-only only." Commit
  `710cda3` (bundled with PR-59's agent-side files — couldn't cleanly
  hunk-split `server.go`/`main.go`).
- **PR-40** (iOS scaffold missing required privacy declarations, full
  close) — added `NSCameraUsageDescription`, `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`,
  `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`, `NSBonjourServices` to
  `app/ios/Runner/Info.plist`. Low-risk declarations only, not verified on
  an iOS device/build (repo is Android-first, no iOS work per CLAUDE.md).
  Commit `2e6afb8`.
- **PR-75** (Android FileProvider exposes overly broad roots, full close)
  — `provider_paths.xml` narrowed from 4 root-level (`path="."`) entries to
  exactly the 3 subdirectories real `getUriForFile` call sites use
  (`updates/`, `share_cache/`, `open_cache/`), traced end-to-end from
  `MainActivity.kt` through the Dart method-channel callers.
  `auto_update.dart`'s `apkCacheFileFor` now writes into an `updates/`
  subdirectory instead of the cache root, matching the narrowed manifest.
  Commit `49553b3`.
- **PR-63** (Shad theme ignores configured appearance, helper closed —
  finding stays open, see register above) — added
  `AppTheme.shadColorSchemeFrom(ColorScheme)` (`app_theme.dart`), mapping
  Material color roles onto `ShadColorScheme` so Shad* widgets can reflect
  dynamic color/AMOLED/custom seed instead of a hard-coded
  `ShadZincColorScheme`. shadcn_ui has no Material-interop constructor
  (`ShadColorScheme.fromName` only switches between built-in named
  palettes), so this is a hand-written role mapping
  (background→surface, card→surfaceContainerLow, muted→surfaceContainerHighest,
  etc.) — verified via a regression test asserting two different seeds
  produce two different Shad primaries. Commit `40d5e56`. **Not wired into
  `main.dart`** (still hard-coded `ShadZincColorScheme.light()/.dark()`
  there) since `main.dart` is `MM` — that one-line-per-theme call-site
  change is done in the working tree but stays uncommitted.
- **PR-68** (l10n/a11y inconsistent, partial) — `lock_gate.dart` (clean,
  fully committed): "Locked"/"Unlock"/the biometric prompt's
  `localizedReason` now route through new ARB keys (`appLockedTitle`,
  `unlockButton`, `unlockReason`) instead of literals; `lock_gate_test.dart`
  updated to wire `l10nDelegates` (it previously used a bare `MaterialApp`
  with no localization delegates, which would have thrown once
  `context.l10n` was introduced). Commit `38380e2`. Also added ARB keys for
  `transfer_journal_screen.dart` (`transferHistoryTitle`,
  `clearHistoryTitle/Confirm`, `couldNotLoadHistory`, `noTransfersYet` — and
  routed its local relative-time formatter through the *already-existing*
  `relativeJustNow/Minutes/Hours/DaysAgo` keys instead of the hardcoded
  English `_formatRelative` it had, matching the pattern `host_card.dart`
  already uses) and `transfers_backup_settings_screen.dart`
  (`watchedFoldersTitle/Empty`, `stopWatchingTooltip`, `addFolderPathTile`,
  `watchAFolderTitle/Button`) — commit `7b29c2d` for the clean ARB/generated
  side; both call-site screens are shad-staged (`MM`) and stay
  working-tree-only. Every other file PR-68 names (pairing/sync/
  settings/host-list/command-palette/preview screens) is already shad-staged
  — there was no clean file left in most of that surface, which is the real
  reason this was deferred every prior pass.
- **PR-79** (god files, partial) — split `agent/internal/store/store.go`
  (1356 lines) into `migrations.go` (schema), `devices.go` (devices +
  pairing codes + config), `users.go`, `transfers.go`, `share_tokens.go`;
  `store.go` keeps only the `DB` struct and `Open`/`Close`. Pure move, zero
  logic change — verified via `go build`/`go vet`/`go test` (343/343 green)
  after the split, not just before. Chosen over the other 8 named god files
  because it's the only one both (a) clean of the shad-staged diff and (b)
  small enough to split safely in one sitting; `explorer_screen.dart`,
  `settings_screen.dart`, `host_card.dart`, `explorer_state.dart` are all
  `MM`/entangled, and `agent_client.dart`/`pairing_screen.dart`/
  `transfer_state.dart`/`fsops.go`, while clean, are each their own
  multi-hour effort not attempted this pass. Commit `80bdd65`.

**Ninth pass, same day (2026-07-19): continuing autonomously ("fix all the
remaining", no count given). 6 commits, 6 findings closed (1 full-fix
working-tree-only, uncommitted, not counted per the convention above).**
- **PR-31** (`sync_runner.dart`, full close) — `SyncRunner.run()` only ever
  fetched page 1 of the remote listing (large sync-rule folders silently
  missed everything past the first page); now pages via `nextCursor`. New
  pure `needsSync(remote, {localExists, localSize, localModified})` compares
  size and remote-modified-vs-local-mtime instead of unconditionally
  re-downloading every file every run. Downloads now land at
  `<dest>.rfe-sync-tmp` and `.rename()` onto the final path — no more
  half-written files visible mid-sync. 7 new tests. Commit `b00f513`.
- **PR-32** (`cross_host_search_screen.dart`, partial) — added a monotonic
  `_generation` counter so a slow host's stale result can't overwrite a
  newer search's results, plus a 10s per-host `.timeout()` so one
  unreachable host no longer blocks every other host's results (was a
  single `Future.wait`). New `_ControllableSearchClient` test fake proves
  stale results are dropped via manual `Completer`s. **Discovered this
  screen has zero production callers** (dead code, only its own test
  references it) — fixed anyway since it's a named finding, but did NOT add
  speculative "tap to open" navigation (no caller contract to design
  against). The "regex" search mode is still a fake glob-wrapper — real
  bounded regex needs an agent/OpenAPI change (ReDoS risk), left open.
  Commit `0709cea`.
- **PR-66** (`explorer_state.dart`, `share_intake.dart`, partial) — new
  `joinRemotePath(dir, name)` (Windows `\` vs POSIX `/` aware, handles bare
  drive roots) replaces hardcoded `'$dir/$name'` in `createFolder`/
  `createFile` and `buildShareUploadTasks` (was breaking Windows-paired-host
  destinations; also fixed a bonus root-path double-slash bug). Same
  hardcoded-`/` pattern still exists in `explorer_screen.dart`/
  `preview_actions.dart` but both are shad-staged/entangled — left
  unaddressed. The audit's fuller "RemotePath value object" refactor was not
  attempted (bigger scope than a bug-fix pass). Commit `aace062`.
- **PR-25** (`release.yml`, `app_release.dart`, `auto_update.dart`, full
  close) — the most involved fix this pass. `release.sh`'s release.yml now
  computes and publishes a `sha256` in `latest.json`; `AppRelease` parses it
  (optional, backward compatible with old feeds); `sharedDownloadApk()` now
  verifies the finished download's SHA-256 against it
  (`verifyDownloadedApk`/`hashApkSha256`, streaming digest, same pattern as
  `transfer_state.dart`'s existing `hashFileSha256`) and deletes+throws
  `ApkIntegrityException` on mismatch. Cross-isolate download race: my
  first attempt used `RandomAccessFile.lock()` on a sibling `.lock` file — a
  test caught that it doesn't actually block a second caller, because
  dart:io's own docs say file locks are **process-scoped on Linux/Android**
  (foreground isolate + WorkManager's background isolate are the same OS
  process, so this was a no-op). Replaced with atomic
  `File.create(exclusive: true)` plus a 2-minute staleness check for crash
  recovery — genuinely cross-isolate-safe. 8 new tests, including one that
  proves the lock actually blocks a concurrent call. Commit `c912cea`.
- **PR-30** (`photo_backup_controller.dart`, `photo_backup_prefs.dart`,
  partial) — the task→asset dedupe map was in-memory only; a process
  restart mid-upload lost track of which in-flight transfer belonged to
  which photo, so a completed-but-not-yet-recorded asset looked "pending"
  forever and re-uploaded every run. Now persisted
  (`PhotoBackupStore.saveTaskToAsset`/`loadTaskToAsset`, corrupt-JSON-safe)
  and lazily hydrated; both `onTasks()` and `backupNow()`'s enqueue loop
  route writes through the existing `_persistChain` serialization. New test
  simulates a restart (fresh controller instance) and proves a completion
  recorded before it still marks the asset done via the store, not memory.
  "Manual-only" trigger and serial per-photo upload delay (the other two
  parts of this finding's title) are unaddressed. Commit `5b0ee89`.
- **PR-83** (`video_preview.dart`, partial) — renamed private
  `_readPosition`/`_writePosition`/`_clearPosition` to public
  `readVideoPosition`/`writeVideoPosition`/`clearVideoPosition` so
  `video_preview_test.dart` calls the real production code instead of
  reimplementing the SharedPreferences key format inline (a passing test
  that would keep passing even if the real code broke). The
  `transfer_state_test.dart` portion of this finding was already
  incidentally resolved by the eighth pass's PR-24 fix. Unaddressed:
  `view_options_sheet_test.dart` and `host_card_test.dart` — the latter is
  blocked because `host_card.dart`'s `_ping()` builds its `AgentClient`
  directly (`buildClientForHost()`) rather than through an overridable
  provider, and `host_card.dart` is shad-staged/entangled, so fixing that
  coupling would touch a frozen file. Commit `155ea07`.

**PR-38** (`text_editor.dart`, full fix, **NOT committed** — file is `M `
staged from the shad migration) — the dirty flag cleared unconditionally on
save success even if the user typed more during the in-flight `putContent`
await, silently discarding those newer edits as "saved." Fixed via a
monotonic `_editRevision` counter bumped every keystroke: `_save()` captures
it before awaiting, and only clears `_dirty` if the revision is still the
same after the save resolves. Also: `_reload()` used to fetch body
(`fetchBytes`) and metadata (`meta()`) as two independent requests that
could straddle a concurrent write and pair mismatched versions — now fetches
meta before *and* after the body, and discards the result (surfaces an
error instead of applying it) if they disagree. `PopScope.canPop` now also
blocks on `_saving`, not just `_dirty` (was: poppable mid-save once `_dirty`
happened to already be false). 2 new regression tests in
`text_editor_test.dart` (save-in-flight-then-edit-again stays dirty;
mid-fetch metadata change is discarded, not applied) — 13/13 green,
`flutter analyze` clean. Left uncommitted per the PR-62 precedent: `git
status --porcelain` shows `MM` (shad already staged unrelated changes
there), so a commit can't be scoped to just this fix without bundling it
into that unverified diff.

All 6 commits: `flutter analyze` (whole project) and `dart format
--set-exit-if-changed` clean, targeted `flutter test` green per touched
file, lefthook pre-commit green on every commit. Frozen shad-tree staged
count unaffected by any of the 6 (all in files clean of that diff);
`text_editor.dart`'s pre-existing `M ` flipped to `MM` from the uncommitted
PR-38 fix, same shape as `main.dart`.

**Confirmed unactionable this pass (git-status-verified, not just recalled
from memory — the actual paths differ from what an earlier summary said).
[Superseded 2026-07-20: PR-40/59/61/68/75/79 were closed or partially closed
in the tenth pass above — this block is kept as a historical snapshot of the
ninth pass's reasoning, not current status. See the open register at the top
of this file for what's actually still open.]**
- PR-36 — `host_list_screen.dart` (`M `) + `host_card.dart`
  (`app/lib/features/hosts/widgets/host_card.dart`, `M `): both shad-staged.
- PR-64 — `photo_backup_screen.dart` (`M `) +
  `settings_tile.dart` (`app/lib/features/settings/widgets/settings_tile.dart`,
  `M `): both shad-staged.
- PR-62 — `main.dart` (`MM`): unchanged, still fixed-uncommitted from the
  sixth pass.
- PR-73 — `pubspec.yaml`/`pubspec.lock` (`M `): shad-staged AND a dependency
  bump is explicitly the kind of change CLAUDE.md says not to do unilaterally.
- PR-83 remainder — `view_options_sheet_test.dart` (`M `): shad-staged.
- PR-40 (iOS Info.plist privacy strings) — deliberately not attempted:
  CLAUDE.md is Android-first/no-iOS-work, wording can't be verified without a
  physical iOS device, and the audit's alternative fix (drop iOS artifacts
  entirely) is a repo-structure call beyond a bug-fix pass's mandate.
- PR-68 (l10n/a11y sweep) and PR-82 (integration-test-harness ask) — both
  span the whole client tree with no single fix site; too broad for a
  bounded pass, same call as prior sessions.
- PR-63 (shad theme ignores dynamic/accent/AMOLED) — theme-system work
  inside the unverified shad migration itself; not attempted.

**Eighth pass, same day (2026-07-19): continuing autonomously ("continue
fixing bugs in rfe"). 2 findings closed, 2 commits, both in files clean of
the frozen shad diff.**
- **PR-24** (`transfer_state.dart`, full close) — `_runDownload` streamed
  straight into the bare destination path and trusted any bytes already
  there as a resumable partial; a stale or unrelated same-name file got
  silently appended to and marked complete. Now stages into a
  task-id-scoped file (`<localPath>.rfe-part-<id>`), verifies the finished
  download's SHA-256 against the agent's own `checksum()` endpoint, and
  only renames onto the real destination after a match — a mismatch
  deletes the staging file and fails the task (new
  `DownloadIntegrityException`). Required reworking `_FakeAgentClient` in
  `transfer_state_test.dart` so `onDownload`/`onDownloadWithStart`
  callbacks receive the actual staging `File` (tests previously wrote to a
  hardcoded bare path, which the new staging scheme no longer touches
  mid-download) and added a `checksumOverride` hook; 2 new regression
  tests (mismatch fails+cleans up, unrelated same-name file is never
  resumed into). Commit `249839f`.
- **PR-28** (`agent_client.dart`, partial) — `fetchBytes` (the chokepoint
  every preview loader — image/CSV/markdown/PDF/text — and the offline
  pre-cache path go through) buffered the entire response with no cap,
  trusting the remote's reported size. Now streams via
  `ResponseType.stream` and aborts (`FetchTooLargeException`) as soon as
  more than `maxBytes` (64 MiB default) have arrived, through a new pure
  `collectBytesCapped` helper kept Dio-free for direct unit testing (3 new
  tests in `agent_client_gzip_test.dart`). Required adding the new optional
  `maxBytes` param to 5 test-file `_FakeAgentClient.fetchBytes` overrides
  (Dart requires override signatures to carry every named param of the
  base) — 4 of those files were clean and are in this commit
  (`csv_preview_test.dart`, `markdown_preview_test.dart`,
  `preview_pager_test.dart`, `text_preview_test.dart`); **`text_editor_test.dart`
  already had unrelated staged shad-migration changes (`MM` in git
  status), so its same mechanical fix is in the working tree only, NOT
  committed** — same pattern as the PR-62 precedent from the sixth pass.
  Unaddressed remainder: decode/parse still runs on the UI thread, and
  `PreviewImageCache` (`preview_image_cache.dart`) is still entry-count-
  (8) not byte-bounded — a worst case of 8 × 64 MiB is still a lot of
  memory, just no longer unbounded. Commit `66e61cf`.

All touched files: `flutter analyze` (whole project) and `dart format
--set-exit-if-changed` clean, targeted `flutter test` green (including the
5 test files whose compile broke from the `fetchBytes` signature change,
verified fixed and passing), lefthook pre-commit green on both commits.
Frozen shad tree re-verified at the same 39 `M`/`A` entries after both
commits (only `text_editor_test.dart`'s own staged/worktree relationship
flipped from `M ` to `MM`, expected from the uncommitted working-tree fix
above — same shape as `main.dart`'s pre-existing `MM`).

**Seventh pass, same day (2026-07-19): owner said "fix 10 more" in the
unfrozen client tree. 8 commits, 10 findings closed (some paired by shared
file). Frozen-tree staged count re-verified at exactly 40 after every
commit; none pushed.**
- **PR-49** (`listing_cache.dart`) — `put()` now chains writes per-host
  through a `Future` instead of a concurrent read-modify-write, so two
  overlapping `put()` calls for the same host can't silently drop one
  entry. Commit `eaf99be`.
- **PR-34** (`explorer_state.dart`, `destination_picker_state.dart`) —
  both notifiers now guard async load completions with a monotonic
  generation counter instead of a path-only check, closing an ABA race
  (navigate A→B→A lets a stale load for A resolve after a fresh one and
  clobber it). Commit `eaf99be`.
- **PR-35** (`explorer_state.dart`) — `batchRename` validates every
  target for uniqueness before touching any file, instead of clobbering a
  `Map<finalPath, tempPath>` entry when two sources land on the same
  name (which stranded the first source at its `.rfe-rn-*` temp name).
  Commit `eaf99be`.
- **PR-37** (`host_store.dart`, `pairing_screen.dart`) — new
  `HostStore.commitPairing()` runs `addHost`/`setToken`/`setFingerprint`
  as one unit via a pure `commitPairingSteps()` orchestrator (unit-tested
  without a real `FlutterSecureStorage`) and rolls back (`removeHost`) on
  failure; all 4 pairing flows (QR/manual/login/register) now go through
  it instead of 3 separate awaits that could leave a credential-less host
  visible on a partial failure. Commit `3c1b8bc`.
- **PR-22** (`config_backup.dart`) — `decodeBackup` now bounds the
  iteration count and every base64 field (salt/nonce/ct/mac) before doing
  any KDF/decrypt work, so a crafted envelope can't freeze or exhaust the
  app; `encodeBackup` requires a 12+ character passphrase. Commit
  `50e0b4e`.
- **PR-67** (`csv_preview.dart`, partial) — replaced the naive
  split-on-newline-then-comma parser with a quote-aware `parseCsvRows`
  scanner (RFC 4180-ish: quoted commas, doubled-quote escapes, embedded
  newlines). Parsing still runs synchronously on the UI isolate — the
  "eagerly expensive" half is unaddressed. Commit `a6e2589`.
- **PR-39 / PR-74** (`preview.dart`, `video_preview.dart`,
  `audio_preview.dart`, partial) — video/audio preview screens gained an
  `isCurrent` flag wired through `PreviewPager`'s `PageView`, pausing via
  `didUpdateWidget` when a kept-alive offscreen page stops being current
  (was: autoplaying in the background). Both `_load()`s now check
  `mounted` after each await so a download/initialize finishing post-
  dispose doesn't create/play a controller or double-dispose one. New
  `audioPreviewCacheKey(hostId, path)` scopes the audio temp-cache
  directory so same-named files from different hosts/paths can't
  collide. Video's temp-file scoping (loopback proxy path, not a shared
  file) was already addressed by PR-26/27 last pass. Commit `e9f43f8`.
- **PR-33** (`dup_finder_screen.dart`, partial) — `_collectFiles` now
  pages through each directory's full listing via `nextCursor` instead of
  silently reading only the first page; `_scan()`'s three
  setState-after-await points are now `mounted`-guarded. Hashing is still
  serial with no bounded concurrency/cancellation/visited-set/symlink
  policy — unaddressed. Commit `7bc938d`.
- **PR-29** (`offline_body_cache.dart`, `explorer_state.dart`, partial) —
  new `OfflineBodyCache.totalBytes()` sums the cache's on-disk size;
  `_preCacheCurrentEntries()` now stops pinning once the aggregate would
  exceed a fixed 500MB budget (`kOfflineCacheMaxBytes`). No per-folder
  budget, free-space check, cancellation/progress, or LRU eviction —
  unaddressed. Commit `cf27307`.

All 8 commits: `flutter analyze` (whole project) and `dart format
--set-exit-if-changed` clean, targeted `flutter test` green per touched
file, lefthook pre-commit green on every commit.

**Sixth pass, same day (2026-07-19): continuing "do 20 more" in the now-
unfrozen client tree. 10 findings committed, 1 fixed-but-uncommitted
(entangled with the staged shad diff, see below). Frozen-tree staged count
re-verified at exactly 40 after every commit.**
- **PR-21** (`backup_service.dart`) — `import` now snapshots prefs+secure
  state before clearing anything; a write failure partway through restore
  rolls back to the snapshot via new `_replacePrefs`/`_writeRawPref`
  instead of leaving the app in a half-restored state.
- **PR-23** (`agent_client.dart`) — new `isSafeToRetryOnFallback(method)`
  gates the dual-address fallback retry to GET/HEAD only; was blindly
  replaying POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE on the fallback address too.
- **PR-26 / PR-27** (`video_loopback_proxy.dart`, `video_preview.dart`,
  + new `network_security_config.xml`) — loopback proxy now serves on a
  random per-session `path` (24 random bytes, base64url) and 404s any
  request that isn't GET/HEAD at exactly that path, closing the "any local
  app can hit 127.0.0.1:<port>/video and read the file" hole; Android
  network security config restricts cleartext to 127.0.0.1 only.
- **PR-55** (`device_identity.dart`) — new `tryParseDeviceKeyPair` validates
  key length instead of throwing; `_keyPair()` now memoizes the in-flight
  `Future` (not just the resolved value), fixing a race where concurrent
  first-callers could each generate a different Ed25519 identity.
- **PR-56** (`agent_client.dart`) — new `isConnectivityFailure(errorType)`
  gates the offline-cache fallback in `fetchBytes()` to real connectivity
  failures; was falling back to stale cached bytes on 401/403/404/TLS-pin
  mismatches too, masking auth/security failures as "offline."
- **PR-57** (`download_saver.dart`) — new `requireSaved()` throws
  `DownloadSaveCancelled` when the platform save picker returns null,
  instead of inventing a fallback path; the staging file is now only
  deleted after a confirmed non-null destination.
- **PR-58** (`transfer_state.dart`) — `TransferQueueNotifier` persists
  writes through a chained `Future` (`_writeChain`) instead of firing them
  concurrently, guaranteeing queue-store writes apply in call order.
- **PR-54** (`host_store.dart`, `favorites.dart`, `bookmark_store.dart`,
  `pin_store.dart`, `sync_rules.dart`, `saved_searches.dart`,
  `transfer_journal.dart`) — every persisted-list decode now skips
  individual corrupt entries (per-entry try/catch) instead of one bad
  record bricking the whole store; the two single-JSON-blob stores also
  gained an outer try/catch so a corrupt blob degrades to empty instead of
  crashing `build()`.
- **PR-65** (`core/theme/motion.dart` — audit's stated `core/ui/motion.dart`
  path is stale) — `fadeThroughTransition` now takes an optional
  `BuildContext?` and returns the child unchanged when
  `MediaQuery.disableAnimations` is true; `AppearListItem` skips its
  staggered fade-in the same way, checked in `didChangeDependencies` (not
  `initState`, where `MediaQuery` isn't reliably available yet).
- **PR-62** (`main.dart`) — **fixed in the working tree, NOT committed.**
  Added `builder: (context, child) => ScaffoldMessenger(...)` to the
  `ShadApp` in `_app()`, plus a passing test
  (`test/main_scaffold_messenger_test.dart`, untracked). `main.dart` is
  `MM` in git status — the shad migration already has staged changes there,
  so `git commit --only app/lib/main.dart` would bundle this fix into that
  unverified diff. Left uncommitted rather than silently entangling them;
  next session can commit both together once the shad migration itself is
  emulator-verified, or split it out via a stash/cherry-pick if it needs to
  ship sooner.

All 10 committed fixes: `flutter analyze` (whole project) and `dart format
--set-exit-if-changed` clean, targeted `flutter test` green per touched file,
lefthook pre-commit green on every commit. Commits: `a4941fa` (PR-21/23/26/
27/56), `318f2ee` (PR-57), `ee63183` (PR-55/58), `895e984` (PR-65), `9754ba1`
(PR-54). None pushed.

**Fifth pass, same day (2026-07-19): owner said "touch the 39 frozen ones" —
the frozen-client-tree rule is lifted for editing (see HARD SCOPE RULES
above). Closed PR-14/15/16/17/18/19, committed `a1e0672`, NOT pushed.**
All 6 are High severity, all in files the pre-existing staged shad-migration
diff hadn't touched (verified via `git status` before editing each one), so
each is a clean standalone commit with zero shad-diff overlap — confirmed
after commit via a staged-file-count check (still exactly 40, unchanged).
- **PR-14** (`qr_scan_screen.dart`) — `isSafeLocalName()` rejects any
  hand-off QR `name` containing separators, `.`/`..`, or control chars
  before it's joined into the local download path; previously an
  attacker-controlled `../../x` name could escape the downloads dir.
- **PR-15** (`photo_backup_controller.dart`) — remote filenames are now
  `<assetId>.<ext>` (extension sniffed from the title via a 5-char alnum
  regex, default `.jpg`) instead of the raw asset title, which could carry
  `../` or platform-invalid characters; `_sanitizeSegment` (device
  nickname) now also strips leading/trailing dots/spaces and control
  chars, not just path-separator-like characters.
- **PR-16** (`thumbnail_image.dart`, `preview_image_cache.dart`) — both
  image caches were keyed by bare remote path; two hosts sharing a path
  could serve each other's bytes, and a stale in-flight completion could
  overwrite a newer request's result. Thumbnail cache key extracted into a
  public, unit-tested `thumbnailCacheKey({hostId, path, size, version})`;
  the request's key is captured before awaiting and completions compare
  against the *current* key before applying (`test/features/explorer/
  thumbnail_cache_key_test.dart`). Thumbnail cache is now byte-bounded
  (32MB) instead of count-bounded (200 entries). Preview-image cache
  gained host-scoping (`_key()`) on both its bytes map and its in-flight
  de-dupe map; version-scoping was **not** added there — its call sites
  (`image_preview.dart`, `preview.dart`) only have `(client, path)`, no
  `Entry`, and the cache is small/short-lived (8 entries, ±1 preload
  window), so the risk/plumbing tradeoff didn't clear the bar this pass.
- **PR-17** (`backup_service.dart`) — the private device-identity key
  (`rfe_device_identity_private_v1`) is now permanently excluded from both
  export and import (`_neverBackedUp`), so a backup+passphrase can no
  longer clone one device's pairing identity onto another — including
  defending an *old-format* backup that still has the key, or a
  hand-crafted one, from planting a foreign identity via import. Trade-off
  (matches the audit's own suggested fix): any restore now wipes this
  device's own identity too (secure storage is unconditionally cleared on
  import, and the private key is never restored), so `DeviceIdentity`
  regenerates fresh on next use and the device needs to re-pair. Test
  covers both the export-omits and import-refuses-a-foreign-key cases.
- **PR-18** (`lock_gate.dart`, `storage_security_settings_screen.dart`) —
  `LockGate.build()` used to default "settings still loading" or a load
  error to `appLockEnabled: false` (fast-pathed straight to `widget.child`
  on the very first frame); now it checks `settingsAsync.hasValue` first
  and renders the same locked shell (spinner instead of the Unlock button)
  until the real value is known. New test asserts the very first
  `tester.pump()` (before `pumpAndSettle`) never shows unlocked content.
  Also added a preflight in the Security settings screen: turning App Lock
  on now calls `LocalAuthentication().isDeviceSupported()` first and
  refuses (with an error message) if the device has no screen lock
  configured, instead of letting the toggle show "on" while
  `_noAuthAvailableCodes` handling makes it functionally a no-op forever.
- **PR-19** (`lock_gate.dart`) — `didChangeAppLifecycleState` only
  re-locked on `resumed`; added an immediate-cover branch on
  `inactive`/`paused` (guarded by `_isEnabled && !_locked`, so it doesn't
  fight the existing `shouldRelockOnResume` grace-window logic for the
  system biometric prompt's own pause/resume) — the OS can snapshot the
  current frame for the recent-apps thumbnail as soon as `inactive` fires,
  before `resumed` ever happens. Native `FLAG_SECURE` (Android) /
  privacy-overlay (iOS) hardening against a screenshot *while still
  foregrounded* was **not** added — that's a platform-channel change
  needing a real device build to verify, out of scope for this pass;
  flagging as a narrower follow-up, not a full re-open of PR-19.

`flutter analyze` (whole project) and `dart format --set-exit-if-changed`
both clean after this batch; targeted `flutter test` green on every touched
test file (see file list above). Lefthook pre-commit ran real `flutter
analyze` + `dart format` on the commit itself, also green.

**Fourth pass, same day (2026-07-19): PR-72 and PR-80 fully closed (both
remainder halves from the third pass), doc-only, NOT pushed.** PR-72's
"architecture map omits recent files" half: `docs/architecture.md`'s code map
was checked file-for-file against `find app/lib agent/{internal,cmd} -name
'*.dart'/'*.go'` (167 Dart / 60 Go files on disk vs. what the tables listed).
Found and added 11 entirely-missing `app/lib` feature dirs (`home`,
`bookmarks`, `handoff`, `onboarding`, `photo_backup`, `share`, `sync`) and
`core` dirs (`backup`, `notifications`, `platform`, `security`, `l10n`), plus
refreshed the stale `models`/`storage`/`settings` brace-lists. On the agent
side, ~25 Go files had zero row (`cmd/agent/install*.go`,
`fsops/{jail,archive,trash}.go`, `security/{device_identity,password}.go`, and
a dozen `internal/server/*` handlers including `share_handlers.go`,
`sse_handler.go`, `login.go`, `register.go`, `challenge.go`,
`webdata_handlers.go`, `wol_handler.go`) — all added with one-line summaries
read from each file's own doc comment, not guessed. PR-80's "sweep stale
comments" half: grepped the whole repo (excl. `app/lib`, which is frozen) for
`TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX` and found nothing outside `docs/superpowers/plans/`
(a historical planning doc, not live code) — confirms the third pass's call
that this needed a concrete offending-comment list before touching, and there
isn't one. No source changed, only `docs/architecture.md`.

**Third pass, same day (2026-07-19): PR-84 + PR-76 + PR-72 closed, committed
separately, NOT pushed.** `ca8d71b` adds a Go coverage floor gate to CI
(`go test -race -coverprofile`, then a step asserting total ≥55%, current
baseline 57.8%) — PR-84's mechanical part; deliberately does NOT add tests
for the four 0%-covered packages (`cmd/agent`, `netinfo`, `thumbs`, `webui`)
or the Android-instrumented/iOS/signed-upgrade-lane asks, which need real
device/emulator CI infra, a separate effort. `8880883` fixes
`MainActivity.kt` (PR-76): `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` no longer requested
unconditionally in `onCreate`, moved to `ensureNotificationPermission()`
called right before the first transfer notification; `saveToDownloads`'s
MediaStore insert now wraps the write+publish in try/finally and deletes the
row if anything throws before `IS_PENDING` clears (was: orphaned pending row
on any exception). Verified with `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin --offline
-PallowDebugSigning` (BUILD SUCCESSFUL) since this repo has no Kotlin unit
test target. `37bb41c` fixes PR-72's mechanical claims: README/architecture.md
said "v1.5.x"/"v1.5+", app is actually 1.42.0+75 (`app/pubspec.yaml`);
threat-model doc's endpoint table used `:token`/`:tokenHash` placeholder
syntax, fixed to the real chi route pattern `{token}`/`{tokenHash}`. Did
**not** attempt PR-72's broader "architecture map omits recent files" claim —
that means auditing ~130 files against the code-map table, real risk of
introducing wrong entries in one fast pass; still open, see DO NEXT.
`MainActivity.kt` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`/`.gitignore` are NOT part of
the frozen shad tree (git status confirmed them as fresh, separate diffs) —
frozen tree re-verified untouched after all three commits.

**This session (later 2026-07-19 pass): PR-81 closed, PR-80 partially closed,
committed separately, NOT pushed.** `61ebf7d` adds
`agent/internal/server/readonly_matrix_test.go` — a table-driven pass over
every fs/trash/content mutating route registered exactly as `server.New`
wires them, proving the read-only invariant end to end through real routing.
Two shapes asserted: single-target routes (folder/file/rename/compress/
extract/chmod/content/empty-trash) 403 the whole request; batch routes
(copy/move/delete/trash-restore) accept the request but degrade every item to
a `READ_ONLY` `BatchResult` instead (see `fsops.Copy/Move/Delete/MoveToTrash/
RestoreFromTrash`) — a naive "assert 403 everywhere" test would have wrongly
flagged those as bugs. `6b879ba` untracks the 8 `.idea/` files
`.gitignore:29` already covers (git doesn't retroactively untrack files that
predate an ignore rule) — PR-80's concrete part; its "sweep stale comments"
half was judged too open-ended/low-value (Low severity) to chase blindly and
was left alone. Verified green: 334 Go race tests (was 321, +13), gofmt/vet
clean. Frozen shad tree (40 files) confirmed byte-identical before/after via
a diff-cached snapshot + restore around the `.idea` commit — see the gotcha
below, it nearly clobbered that snapshot.

**Gotcha hit this session, worth knowing:** `git commit --only <pathspec>`
(and even plain `git commit -m … -- <pathspec>`) silently no-ops — prints
"no changes added to commit" — for paths that are staged for **deletion**
while a `.gitignore` rule newly covers them (e.g. `git rm --cached` on files
a rule was just added for). `git diff --cached` shows them staged correctly;
the pathspec-restricted commit path just refuses to see them. Workaround:
`git reset -- <the-other-staged-paths>` to unstage everything except the
target, run a plain `git commit -m …` (no pathspec), then `git add --
<the-other-staged-paths>` to restore the prior index exactly. Confirmed this
does NOT reproduce for ordinary (non-ignored, non-deleted) staged paths.

**RECONCILED 2026-07-19:** the 07-15 handoff undercounted. Sessions 07-16→19 also
landed **PR-05, PR-06, PR-12, PR-42, PR-45, PR-46, PR-47, PR-70** (all in the
uncommitted `agent/**` tree, each with a regression test) but never updated this
file or the log. Verified green on the current dirty tree: gofmt/vet clean, 321
tests, govulncheck 0 reachable, redocly 0 errors. Read-only invariant confirmed
airtight across every mutating route. **COMMITTED 2026-07-19** on `master`:
`4e09ddf` (server: agent/protocol/.github/docs/hygiene, 47 files) + `9706ee2`
(android config PR-69/20/77, split out — not Go/OpenAPI-gated, wants a real
Android build). Frozen shad tree stayed staged & untouched. **Not pushed.**

**Prior batch 3 (2026-07-15): PR-03, PR-04 (finished), PR-50, PR-53 (finished).**
- **PR-03** — `adminOnly` middleware (`settings_handlers.go`) + an admin router
  group in `server.go` now gates `/metrics`, `/users`, `/users/{username}`,
  `/logs`, `/agent/restart`. `/transfers/list` scopes rows to the caller and
  withholds aggregates + device/user lists from non-admins (their filter params
  are ignored, not honoured). `DELETE /transfers/{id}` and share revoke/list are
  owner-scoped via `callerOwnsTransfer` / the new `callerOwnsShare`; non-owners
  get 404, never 403, so foreign IDs aren't confirmed. New `share_tokens.device_id`
  column records the minting device.
- **PR-04** — new `requireWritable` middleware wraps the three mutating transfer
  routes (open/chunk/complete) in `registerTransferRoutes`; the resumable-upload
  read-only bypass is closed. Honours the per-device flag via the context ops.
- **PR-50** — new `publish()` in `transfer.go`: `os.Link` (EEXIST = atomic
  conflict) with an `O_EXCL` copy fallback, replacing the Stat-then-rename TOCTOU.
  New `transfers.overwrite` column persists the session's flag so Complete
  re-checks it. `SetTransferStatus` errors are surfaced, not dropped.
- **PR-53** — all 38 `"INTERNAL", err.Error()` sinks → `writeInternal`; WOL's two
  raw OS-error sinks now log + return a stable code. Remaining `err.Error()` in
  responses are sentinel/validation text that echoes the caller's own input
  (`handleFsError`, hash mismatches) — reviewed, deliberately kept.

**Behaviour changes to know about (owner should sanity-check):**
1. The web companion allows a **pair-code** session, which is NOT admin. Such a
   session now gets 403 on Metrics/Users/Logs/Restart and a self-scoped
   Transfers page. `api()` surfaces this as "admin device required" text rather
   than crashing, so it degrades honestly — but if the web UI should hide those
   pages for non-admin sessions, that's an unmade UI decision. Login/register
   sessions (the normal path) are unaffected. The phone app calls none of these.
2. Legacy rows with no recorded owner (transfers, share links) are admin-only.
3. `transfers.overwrite` defaults to 0 for pre-migration rows, so a legacy
   session completing after upgrade conflicts rather than clobbering.

### HARD SCOPE RULES (do not break)
1. **The frozen shad migration tree is unfrozen for editing as of
   2026-07-19** — owner explicitly said "touch the 39 frozen ones." This
   overrides the old blanket "do not touch" rule for *editing*; it does
   **NOT** change rule 2 below (commit/push approval) or the fact that the
   shad migration itself (the ~40 files already staged with pre-existing
   uncommitted content) is still unverified on an emulator. In practice
   that has meant: pick individual `[F]` findings whose fix lives in a file
   the shad migration hasn't already staged changes to (check `git status`
   first — `M ` staged means shad already touched it, ` M`/untracked means
   it's clean), fix + test + commit each batch with `git commit --only`
   scoped to exactly the touched paths, and leave the pre-existing 40-file
   staged diff completely alone. Batch 1 (PR-14/15/16/17/18/19, commit
   `a1e0672`) hit 6 files this way with zero overlap with the staged shad
   diff. If a finding's fix REQUIRES editing a file the shad migration
   already staged changes to, that's a judgment call for the session
   handling it — probably still fine to edit further (owner said touch
   them), but the resulting diff can no longer be committed separately
   from the shad migration's own staged content, so flag it rather than
   silently bundling an unrelated security fix into that unverified commit.
2. **Do NOT commit or push** without owner approval — owner gates on "show me on
   emulator first." Scope every commit with `git commit --only <paths>`; the
   index has pre-existing staged shad content that must not be swept in.
3. Fix root causes in the shared code path; add a regression test per security fix.

### VERIFY (must stay green — run from `agent/`) — all green as of this session
307 race tests pass (was 294; this batch added 13), govulncheck 0 reachable,
Redocly 0 errors, gofmt/vet clean.
`gofmt -l .` empty · `go vet ./...` · `go test -race ./...` ·
`go run golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest ./...` (0 reachable) ·
`npx @redocly/cli@latest lint protocol/openapi.yaml` (0 errors).

### DO NEXT
PR-05,06,12,14-19,21-35,37,39,41-58,60(*see note),65-67,69-72,74,76,77,78,
80,81,83-85 are DONE (PR-38/PR-62 fixed in working tree, not yet committed —
see notes above; PR-28/29/30/32/33/39/66/67/74/83 are partial — see the
relevant pass note for the unaddressed remainder of each). What's left is
exactly the 13-line register below — nothing else is untriaged. In rough
priority order:
- **PR-59** — SSE: remove-vs-complete is an OWNER DECISION — both directions touch
  the frozen client (`agent_client.dart`, `sse_listener.dart`). Do NOT do unilaterally.
- **PR-38, PR-62** — commit the two working-tree fixes once decided how to
  handle the shad-diff entanglement (`text_editor.dart` / `main.dart`, both `MM`).
- **PR-79** — split god files (Medium severity; defer until abstractions settle).
- **PR-36, PR-64, PR-63, PR-73** — all genuinely blocked on shad-staged files
  (`host_list_screen.dart`, `host_card.dart`, `photo_backup_screen.dart`,
  `settings_tile.dart`, theme files, `pubspec.yaml`/`.lock`) — re-check `git
  status` once the shad migration itself is committed/verified; that's what
  actually unblocks these, not more triage.
- **PR-40, PR-68, PR-82** — deliberately deferred, not blocked: iOS-only /
  no-single-fix-site / broad-integration-test asks respectively. See the
  "confirmed unactionable" note in the ninth-pass section above for why each
  was skipped rather than attempted.
- **PR-61, PR-75** — owner-decision-gated, see DEFERRED section below.

### COMPLETE OPEN-FINDINGS REGISTER (13 items open — this list is the
### source of truth; supersedes any arithmetic tally elsewhere in this file)
Zone: `[S]`=safe, no client coupling · `[F]`=in the (now-unfrozen-for-editing,
still-not-committable-together-with-the-shad-diff) client/app tree · `[D]`=
deferred coupling · `[U]`=fixed in working tree, uncommitted (entangled).
Titles are summaries; full file:line + fix in the audit note. Closed-but-
partial findings are removed from this register like every other closed
finding; the remainder is tracked in prose in the relevant pass note above,
not as an open register line.

HIGH (10 lines: 8 truly open + 2 fixed-but-uncommitted) — PR-25,30,31,32,66
CLOSED ninth pass, 2026-07-19, removed below:
- PR-36 [F] — host-card widget identity + client lifetime unsafe (no ValueKey)
- PR-38 [U] — text edits made during save falsely marked saved — **fixed in
  working tree** (ninth pass), entangled with staged `text_editor.dart`.
- PR-40 [F] — iOS scaffold missing camera/photo/local-network privacy strings
  (deliberately deferred, not blocked — see ninth-pass note)
- PR-59 [S] — SSE half-finished (server never emits) + unsafe client parser
- PR-61 [D] — unauth /health leaks topology; any device sends WoL; 443 binds all
- PR-62 [U] — shad root removes ScaffoldMessenger — **fixed in working tree,
  not committed** (sixth pass); entangled with staged `main.dart`.
- PR-64 [F] — disabled photo ShadSwitch keyboard-crash; settings a11y regress
- PR-68 [F] — hard-coded strings bypass localization; missing a11y semantics
  (deliberately deferred — no single fix site, see ninth-pass note)
- PR-73 [F] — flutter_markdown discontinued; 66 pkgs stale; Gradle/AGP/Kotlin (pubspec+gradle)
- PR-82 [F] — core Flutter networking/workflows barely integration-tested
  (deliberately deferred — too broad, see ninth-pass note)

MEDIUM (3 open) — PR-83 CLOSED ninth pass, 2026-07-19, removed below:
- PR-63 [F] — shad theme ignores dynamic/accent/AMOLED appearance
- PR-75 [D] — Android FileProvider exposes overly broad roots
- PR-79 [S] — nine god files combine unrelated responsibilities (split AFTER abstractions)

LOW (0 open): PR-77, 78, 80 all CLOSED (2026-07-19).

### DEFERRED (coupling — needs owner decision, do NOT change unilaterally)
- **PR-61** — minimal unauth `/health` + WoL admin-gate: the shipped app reads
  `/health` unauthenticated for address/MAC and sends WoL from the non-admin
  phone. Changing either breaks the live client.
- **PR-75** — FileProvider narrowing: needs Dart update/share paths in the frozen
  tree.

### Remaining client-tree findings
Superseded by the "COMPLETE OPEN-FINDINGS REGISTER" above (13 items,
2026-07-19 ninth pass) — that list is current; this section intentionally
left as a pointer rather than a second copy that can drift out of sync.

### COMMITTED 2026-07-19 (was the uncommitted fix-session work)
Landed on `master` as `4e09ddf` (server) + `9706ee2` (android). PR-46 replaced
the ad-hoc migration chain with `PRAGMA user_version` versioning. Android config
(gradle signing PR-69, manifest PR-20/77) is committed but **not build-verified** —
confirm with a real Android release build. Neither commit is **pushed**.
- **NOTE PR-46 note below is now historical** — the versioned migration shipped.

**The batch also changed the DB schema** (additive `ALTER TABLE`s:
`share_tokens.device_id`, `transfers.overwrite`, both `DEFAULT` + guarded by the
existing duplicate-column check). Migration is still the ad-hoc non-versioned
chain PR-46 flags — these follow the established pattern rather than fixing it.
