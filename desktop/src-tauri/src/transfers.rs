//! File downloads and uploads against the agent's transfer API, driven from the Rust core.
//!
//! Downloads read `GET /content` in `Range` segments into a hidden part file in the downloads folder
//! and move it to its final name only when it is whole and (when the agent can say) verified, so a
//! cancelled or failed download never leaves a file under a real name. A part file is kept after a
//! failure, and a retry continues from its size. Uploads use the resumable session API: the whole
//! file's SHA-256 is sent when the session opens, every chunk carries its own SHA-256, and the agent
//! verifies the whole file and renames it into place when the upload is completed. A retry asks the
//! agent which chunks it already has and sends only the rest.
//!
//! The window never sees a token or a URL: it starts a transfer by remote or local path and polls
//! `transfer_list`. At most [`PARALLEL`] transfers run at once, the rest wait. The list lives in
//! memory; after a restart the window starts with an empty list (a part file left behind by a crash
//! stays in the downloads folder under a name starting `.rfe-`).
